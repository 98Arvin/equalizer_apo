# Peace EQ Presets (Equalizer APO)
================

**Repository Overview**
------------------------

This repository is a collection of my personal Equalizer APO presets for various headsets I use. The goal is to keep track of my preferred EQ settings for each headset, allowing me to easily switch between them and maintain a consistent listening experience.

**What is Equalizer APO?**
-------------------------

Equalizer APO is a free, open-source equalizer software for Windows that allows users to adjust the frequency response of their audio output. It's a powerful tool for fine-tuning the sound of your headphones or speakers to your liking.


**Preset Format**
----------------

Each preset file is in the Equalizer APO format, which is a simple text file containing the frequency response data. You can import these files directly into Equalizer APO on your machine.
